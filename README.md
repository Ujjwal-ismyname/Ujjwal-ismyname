# Hi, I'm Ujjwal Aggarwal 👋  

I’m a **Computer Science & Business Systems undergraduate** at **Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology** with a strong bias toward **building systems that actually work at scale**.  
I enjoy turning messy real-world data into clean, decision-ready pipelines and designing ML-driven products with clear business impact.

## 🧠 What I Care About
- **Data → Decisions**: engineering pipelines that don’t break under volume
- **Machine Learning with intent**, not buzzwords
- **Clean architecture**, reproducibility, and measurable impact
- Bridging **engineering depth** with **business context**
